intent_model.pkl
This is trained intent classifier, a Naive Bayes model from scikit-learn and predicts the intent label (like "greeting", "test", "goodbye", etc.). it's a trained classifier. Helps with prediction. 

vectorizer.pkl
This stores the TF-IDF vectorizer used for intent classification and vectorizer converts it into a numerical feature vector. it's like a preprocessing object for classifier.

kb_vectorizer.pkl
TF-IDF vectorizer, used for semantic KB search (like retrieval-based). Converts all example sentences in the KB into numerical vectors for similarity search. it's a preprocessing object for KB search.

kb_embeddings.pkl
This contains the matrix of TF-IDF embeddings for all knowledge base examples. When a query comes, we compute cosine similarity between the query vector and these embeddings to find the closest matching KB entry. A learned representation of KB text

kb_responses.pkl
For response - A list of all responses from the knowledge base, aligned with the embeddings. If KB entry at index 5 has the highest similarity to a query, we fetch kb_responses[5] and return it. during system loading and after query, it finds template answer.


During system loads:

vectorizer.pkl → converts to feature vector

intent_model.pkl → predicts "order_status" intent

intent_responses.pkl (not listed, but also saved) → finds template answer

If intent uncertain → fallback to KB search:

kb_vectorizer.pkl → convert query

Compare with kb_embeddings.pkl using cosine similarity

Retrieve answer from kb_responses.pkl
